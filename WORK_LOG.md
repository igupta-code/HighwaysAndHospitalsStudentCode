| Sept 10 | 4:45-5:15pm |                                                                                         I figured out that adding a highway is always better than adding a hospital. I considered finding the city with the most highways connecting it, but that's very inefficient. |
|         |             | I also considered using a queue like in snakes and ladders: an array list would store whether or not the city has been connected and add to the queue if not. You would add a hospital to each "cluster" of cities. Not quite sure how the implementation would work. |
