| Sept 10 | 4:45-5:15pm |                                                                                         I figured out that adding a highway is always better than adding a hospital. I considered finding the city with the most highways connecting it, but that's very inefficient. |
|         |             | I also considered using a queue like in snakes and ladders: an array list would store whether or not the city has been connected and add to the queue if not. You would add a hospital to each "cluster" of cities. Not quite sure how the implementation would work. |
| Sept 10 |  5:15-6:00  |          You would need a way to keep track of what highway's you have "built". I did some research and found this thing called union find. It allows you to keep track of clusters and represent each cluster by assigning it to a representative from that cluster. |
|         |             |                                                                                                                                                   With union find you can see if two cities belong to the same cluster by checking if its representative is the same. |

| Sept 12 | 7:45-8:15   |                                                                                                                                        We can start off by going through all the cities from 0 up. If the city connected to 0 is not already in a cluster, we add it. |
|         |             |                            Once the whole cluster is complete(ie no more cities can be added) add a hospital to the reference city(or just increase a H counter). Then we can move onto the next cluster-- having trouble with knowing where the next cluster starts. |
