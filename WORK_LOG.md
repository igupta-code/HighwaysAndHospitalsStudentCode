| Sept 10 |   4:45-5:15pm   |                                                                                                                                                                               I figured out that adding a highway is always better than adding a hospital. I considered finding the city with the most highways connecting it, but that's very inefficient. |
|         |                 |                                                                                       I also considered using a queue like in snakes and ladders: an array list would store whether or not the city has been connected and add to the queue if not. You would add a hospital to each "cluster" of cities. Not quite sure how the implementation would work. |
| Sept 10 |    5:15-6:00    |                                                                                                You would need a way to keep track of what highway's you have "built". I did some research and found this thing called union find. It allows you to keep track of clusters and represent each cluster by assigning it to a representative from that cluster. |

| Sept 12 |   7:45-8:15am   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              We can start off by going through all the cities from 0 up. If the city connected to 0 is not already in a cluster, we add it. |
|         |                 |                                                                                                                  Once the whole cluster is complete(ie no more cities can be added) add a hospital to the reference city(or just increase a H counter). Then we can move onto the next cluster-- having trouble with knowing where the next cluster starts. |
| Sept 12 |     9-9:30      | Thinking of connecting both approaches above: use a for loop to go through every element. Also create a has visited map. Create a highway between all possible elements in a subgroup and once you are done (mark each as visited). Once the cluster is done, add it number of cities in the cluster to an array list. Then you move onto the next element. |
|         |                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                               If the element has been visited skip it. At the end, do some algebra to figure out the number of hospitals(length of arraylist) and highways. |
| Sept 12 | 10:15 - 10:45am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Started on some code by initializing my toVisit map, array list, and queue. |
| Sept 12 |   8:15-8:45pm   |                                                                                             Started on the code based on Mr. B's slideshow/explaination. Set up the main part of the code that figures out what the root of each number is and compares them. Had some trouble figuring out the root -- I feel like my approach may not be the fastest way. |
| Sept 13 |   10:30-11am    |                                                                                                                                                                                 Printed out and ran into some errors. Tried using the debugger but am not sure what's going on yet. Fixed one small bug(i was comparing two things that were always equal). |
| Sept 17 |  9:40-10:20pm   |                                                                                                                    Okay, fixed some annoyingly hard to find bugs. I initialized my array to size n, but never used the 0 index, so I was short an element. Later, I counted that empty zero as a cluster. All checks are still not working :( but some are! |
| Sept 18 |   10:10-10:30   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Tutorial -- fixed a bug. Checked if hospitals were cheaper than highways. In this case build hospitals everywhere. |
| Sept 19 |      6-7pm      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Spent sooo sooo long figuring out this tiny little bug in my path compression while loop :(. |
| Sept 21 |   10:15-11:00   |                                                                        I added in path compression and did some debugging with the implementation. The negatives were confusing to think through but not an issue. I had to change the way I checked from my roots (before I was saying its a root if it = 0 but now its a root if it's a negative number). |
| Sept 22 |   4:45-5:15pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Debugged my path compression a bit for the second root. This helped pass some of the longer test cases. |
