| Sept 10 |   4:45-5:15pm   |                                                                                                                                                                               I figured out that adding a highway is always better than adding a hospital. I considered finding the city with the most highways connecting it, but that's very inefficient. |

You would add a hospital to each "cluster" of cities. Not quite sure how the implementation would work. |
| Sept 10 |    5:15-6:00    |                                                                                                You would need a way to keep track of what highway's you have "built". I did some research and found this thing called union find. It allows you to keep track of clusters and represent each cluster by assigning it to a representative from that cluster. |

| Sept 12 |   7:45-8:15am   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              We can start off by going through all the cities from 0 up. If the city connected to 0 is not already in a cluster, we add it. |
|         |                 |                                                                                                                  Once the whole cluster is complete(ie no more cities can be added) add a hospital to the reference city(or just increase a H counter). Then we can move onto the next cluster-- having trouble with knowing where the next cluster starts. |
| Sept 12 |     9-9:30      | Thinking of connecting both approaches above: use a for loop to go through every element. Also create a has visited map. Create a highway between all possible elements in a subgroup and once you are done (mark each as visited). Once the cluster is done, add it number of cities in the cluster to an array list. Then you move onto the next element. |

At the end, do some algebra to figure out the number of hospitals(length of arraylist) and highways. |

Set up the main part of the code that figures out what the root of each number is and compares them. Had some trouble figuring out the root -- I feel like my approach may not be the fastest way.  |
